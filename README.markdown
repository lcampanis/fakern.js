The Fakern plugin will apply kerning values on specific letter combinations.
 *  The values for the pairs were taken from a sample list from the Adobe site
 *  http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_kerning1.html
 *  The plugin will factor all values by the element's font-size regardless of its unit. 
 *  It will force pixels as kerning units, in order to avoid doctype issues.
